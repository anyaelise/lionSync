			<h3>What is LIONSync?</h3>
			<p>The dominant paradigm of internet access in the developing world is intermittence - sometimes people have access to internet, sometimes they don't. However, water and sanitation professionals require full-time access to comprehensive planning databases on rural water supply and sanitation coverage, regardless of their connectivity at a given moment in time. LIONSync provides a framework for water and sanitation professionals to enter, access, and analyze data offline, and have data sync between multiple users when connected to the internet. This allows field-level staff to seamlessly use data for planning, and national-level staff to receive regular updates without the need to request and transmit individual reports.</p>

				<li>Works seamlessly without an internet connection</li>
